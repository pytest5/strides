# Stridy MVP

**Stridy MVP** is a platform designed to help individuals and teams **track, visualize, and optimize their environmental impact**. It enables users to log waste collection activities (strides), track progress through interactive maps, and analyze contributions over time via leaderboards and analytics.

This platform was originally built as an **MVP for a non-profit organization** to explore how data visualization and tracking can empower environmental efforts. Following the MVP, the organization engaged a full-stack developer to further enhance their platform.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to track their individual strides.
- **Team Leaderboards**: Track and compare strides across teams to encourage collaboration and competition.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: View strides on an interactive map with Mapbox, showing the quantity and type of waste collected.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users, teams, and stride data.
- **Analytics**: View charts and graphs to see the breakdown of collected items over time.
